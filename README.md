# edd - Empirical distribution distances

This R package collects distance functions between empirical distributions. The purpose of the package is to provide a common framework for comparing empirical distributions and not to provide novel distance measures. It currently includes the following distance measures:
- [Wasserstein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric)
- [Hausdorff distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance)
- [Symmetric Kullbackâ€“Leibler distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence)
